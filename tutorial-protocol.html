<h1 id="tutorial-implementing-a-network-protocol">Tutorial: Implementing a network protocol</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this tutorial you will learn how to implement a simple network protocol using libdill.</p>
<p>The source code for individual steps of this tutorial can be found in <code>tutorial/protocol</code> subdirectory.</p>
<p>Please note that the test program as presented in this text is kept succint by ommitting all the asserts. The source code files for the tutorial, however, do the error checking properly.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-creating-a-handle">Step 1: Creating a handle</h2>
<p>Handles are libdill's equivalent of file descriptors. A socket implementing our protocol will be pointed to by a handle. Therefore, we have to learn how to create custom handle types.</p>
<p>Standard include file for libdill is <code>libdill.h</code>. In this case, however, we will include <code>libdillimpl.h</code> which defines all the functions <code>libdill.h</code> does but also adds some extra stuff that can be used to implement different plugins to libdill, such as new handle types or new socket types:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="ot">#include &lt;libdillimpl.h&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>To make it clear what API we are trying to implement, let's start with a simple test program. We'll call our protocol <code>quux</code> and at this point we will just open and close the handle:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">int</span> main(<span class="dt">void</span>) {
    <span class="dt">int</span> h = quux_open();
    hclose(h);
    <span class="kw">return</span> <span class="dv">0</span>;
}</code></pre>
<p>To start with the implementation we need a structure to hold data for the handle. At the moment it will contain only handle's virtual function table:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">struct</span> quux {
    <span class="kw">struct</span> hvfs hvfs;
};</code></pre>
<p>Let's add forward declarations for functions that will be filled into the virtual function table. We'll learn what each of them is good for shortly:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">void</span> *quux_hquery(<span class="kw">struct</span> hvfs *hvfs, <span class="dt">const</span> <span class="dt">void</span> *id);
<span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">void</span> quux_hclose(<span class="kw">struct</span> hvfs *hvfs);
<span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">int</span> quux_hdone(<span class="kw">struct</span> hvfs *hvfs, <span class="dt">int64_t</span> deadline);</code></pre>
<p>The <code>quux_open</code> function itself won't do much except for allocating the object, filling in the table of virtual functions and registering it with libdill runtime:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">int</span> quux_open(<span class="dt">void</span>) {
    <span class="dt">int</span> err;
    <span class="kw">struct</span> quux *self = malloc(<span class="kw">sizeof</span>(<span class="kw">struct</span> quux));
    <span class="kw">if</span>(!self) {err = ENOMEM; <span class="kw">goto</span> error1;}
    self-&gt;hvfs.query = quux_hquery;
    self-&gt;hvfs.close = quux_hclose;
    self-&gt;hvfs.done = quux_hdone;
    <span class="dt">int</span> h = hmake(&amp;self-&gt;hvfs);
    <span class="kw">if</span>(h &amp;lt; <span class="dv">0</span>) {<span class="dt">int</span> err = errno; <span class="kw">goto</span> error2;}
    <span class="kw">return</span> h;
error2:
    free(self);
error1:
    errno = err;
    <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;
}</code></pre>
<p>Function <code>hmake()</code> does the trick. You pass it a virtual function table and it returns a handle. When the standard function like <code>hclose()</code> is called on the handle libdill will forward the call to the corresponding virtual function, in this particular case to <code>quux_hclose()</code>. The interesting part is that the first argument to the virtual function is no longer the handle but rather pointer to the virtual function table. And given that virtual function table is a member of <code>struct quux</code> it's easy to convert it to the pointer to the quux object itself. <code>quux_hclose()</code> virtual function will deallocate the quux object:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">void</span> quux_hclose(<span class="kw">struct</span> hvfs *hvfs) {
    <span class="kw">struct</span> quux *self = (<span class="kw">struct</span> quux*)hvfs;
    free(self);
}</code></pre>
<p>At the moment we can just return <code>ENOTSUP</code> from the other two virtual functions.</p>
<p>Compile the file and run it to test whether it works as expected:</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc -o step1 step1.c -ldill</code></pre>
<h2 id="step-2-implementing-an-operation-on-the-handle">Step 2: Implementing an operation on the handle</h2>
<p>Consider a UDP socket. It is actually multiple things. It's a handle and as such it exposes functions like <code>hclose()</code>. It's a message socket and as such it exposes functions like <code>msend()</code> and <code>mrecv()</code>. It's also a UDP socket per se and as such it exposes functions like <code>udp_send()</code> or <code>udp_recv()</code>.</p>
<p>libdill provides an extremely generic mechanism to address this multi-faceted nature of handles. In fact, the mechanism is so generic that it's almost silly. There's a <code>hquery()</code> function which takes ID as an argument and returns a void pointer. No assumptions are made about the nature of the ID or nature of the returned pointer. Everything is completely opaque.</p>
<p>To see how that can be useful let's implement a new function for quux handle.</p>
<p>First, we have to define an ID for <code>quux</code> objects. Now, this may be a bit confusing, but the ID is actually a void pointer. The advantage of using a pointer as an ID is that if it was an integer you would have to worry about ID collisions, especially if you define IDs in different libraries that are then linked together. With pointers there's no such problem. You can take a pointer of a global variable and it's guaranteed to be unique as two pieces of data can't live at the same memory address:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">const</span> <span class="dt">int</span> quux_id_placeholder = <span class="dv">0</span>;
<span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">const</span> <span class="dt">void</span> *quux_id = &amp;quux_id_placeholder;</code></pre>
<p>Second, let's implement <code>quux_hquery</code> virtual function, empty implementation of which has been created in previous step of this tutorial:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">void</span> *quux_hquery(<span class="kw">struct</span> hvfs *hvfs, <span class="dt">const</span> <span class="dt">void</span> *id) {
    <span class="kw">struct</span> quux *self = (<span class="kw">struct</span> quux*)hvfs;
    <span class="kw">if</span>(id == quux_id) <span class="kw">return</span> self;
    errno = ENOTSUP;
    <span class="kw">return</span> NULL;
}</code></pre>
<p>To understand what this is good for think of it from user's perspective: You call <code>hquery()</code> function and pass it a handle and ID of quux handle type. The function will fail with <code>ENOTSUP</code> if the handle is not a quux handle. It will return pointer to <code>quux</code> structure otherwise. You can use the pointer to perform useful work on the object.</p>
<p>But wait! Doesn't it break encapsulation? Anyone can call <code>hquery()</code> function, get the pointer to raw quux object and mess with it in unforeseen ways.</p>
<p>But no. Note that <code>quux_id</code> is defined as static. The ID is not available anywhere except in the file that implements quux handle. No external code will be able to get the raw object pointer. The encapsulation works after all.</p>
<p>That being said, we can finally implement our new user-facing function:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">int</span> quux_frobnicate(<span class="dt">int</span> h) {
    <span class="kw">struct</span> quux *self = hquery(h, quux_type);
    <span class="kw">if</span>(!self) <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;Kilroy was here!</span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>);
    <span class="kw">return</span> <span class="dv">0</span>;
}</code></pre>
<p>Modify the test to call the new function, compile it and run it:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">int</span> main(<span class="dt">void</span>) {
    <span class="dt">int</span> h = quux_open(); 
    quux_frobnicate(h);
    hclose(h);
    <span class="kw">return</span> <span class="dv">0</span>;
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="step-3-attaching-and-detaching-a-socket">Step 3: Attaching and detaching a socket</h2>
<p>Nice. We have a functional handle now, but in the end we want quux to be a network protocol handle. Let's say it will be a message-based protocol that can run on top of arbitrary bytestream protocol such as TCP or UNIX domain sockets.</p>
<p>First, we need to store the underlying socket in quux object:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">struct</span> quux {
    <span class="kw">struct</span> hvfs hvfs;
    <span class="dt">int</span> u;
};</code></pre>
<p>To accomodate libdill's naming conventions for protocols running on top of other protocols, we have to rename <code>quux_open()</code> to <code>quux_attach()</code>. We can also reuse <code>quux_frobnicate()</code> and rename it to <code>quux_detach()</code>. Attach function will accept a handle of the underlying bytestream protocol and create quux protocol on top of it. <code>quux_detach()</code> will terminate the quux protocol and return the handle of the underlying protocol:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">int</span> quux_attach(<span class="dt">int</span> u) {
    <span class="dt">int</span> err;
    <span class="kw">struct</span> quux *self = malloc(<span class="kw">sizeof</span>(<span class="kw">struct</span> quux));
    <span class="kw">if</span>(!self) {err = ENOMEM; <span class="kw">goto</span> error1;}
    self-&gt;hvfs.query = quux_hquery;
    self-&gt;hvfs.close = quux_hclose;
    self-&gt;hvfs.done = quux_hdone;
    self-&gt;u = u;
    <span class="dt">int</span> h = hmake(&amp;self-&gt;hvfs);
    <span class="kw">if</span>(h &amp;lt; <span class="dv">0</span>) {<span class="dt">int</span> err = errno; <span class="kw">goto</span> error2;}
    <span class="kw">return</span> h;
error2:
    free(self);
error1:
    errno = err;
    <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;
}

<span class="dt">int</span> quux_detach(<span class="dt">int</span> h) {
    <span class="kw">struct</span> quux *self = hquery(h, quux_type);
    <span class="kw">if</span>(!self) <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;
    <span class="dt">int</span> u = self-&gt;u;
    free(self);
    <span class="kw">return</span> u;
}</code></pre>
<p>Now we can modify the test program to build two quux sockets on top of two mutually connected UNIX domain (ipc) sockets:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">coroutine <span class="dt">void</span> client(<span class="dt">int</span> s) {
    quux_attach(s);
    <span class="co">/* Do something useful here! */</span>
    s = quux_detach(q);
    hclose(s);
}

<span class="dt">int</span> main(<span class="dt">void</span>) {
    <span class="dt">int</span> ss[<span class="dv">2</span>];
    ipc_pair(ss);
    go(client(ss[<span class="dv">0</span>]));
    <span class="dt">int</span> q = quux_attach(ss[<span class="dv">1</span>]);
    <span class="co">/* Do something useful here! */</span>
    <span class="dt">int</span> s = quux_detach(q);
    hclose(s);
    <span class="kw">return</span> <span class="dv">0</span>;
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="step-4-sending-and-receiving-messages">Step 4: Sending and receiving messages</h2>
<p>Now that we've spent previous three steps with boring scaffolding work we can finally do some fun protocol stuff.</p>
<p>Quux protocol is going to be message-based protocol. Therefore, we have to implement <code>msend()</code> and <code>mrecv()</code> functions. We can do that by implementing <code>msock</code> virtual function table:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">struct</span> quux {
    <span class="kw">struct</span> hvfs hvfs;
    <span class="kw">struct</span> msock_vfs mvfs;
    <span class="dt">int</span> u;
};</code></pre>
<p>Forward declarations for <code>msock</code> functions:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">int</span> quux_msendl(<span class="kw">struct</span> msock_vfs *mvfs,
    <span class="kw">struct</span> iolist *first, <span class="kw">struct</span> iolist *last, <span class="dt">int64_t</span> deadline);
<span class="dt">static</span> ssize_t quux_mrecvl(<span class="kw">struct</span> msock_vfs *mvfs,
    <span class="kw">struct</span> iolist *first, <span class="kw">struct</span> iolist *last, <span class="dt">int64_t</span> deadline);</code></pre>
<p>Fill in the virtual function table in <code>quux_attach()</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">int</span> quux_attach(<span class="dt">int</span> u) {
    ...
    self-&gt;mvfs.msendl = quux_msendl;
    self-&gt;mvfs.mrecvl = quux_mrecvl;
    ...
}</code></pre>
<p>Return the <code>msock</code> virtual function table when <code>hquery()</code> is called with approriate type identifier:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">void</span> *quux_hquery(<span class="kw">struct</span> hvfs *hvfs, <span class="dt">const</span> <span class="dt">void</span> *type) {
    <span class="kw">struct</span> quux *self = (<span class="kw">struct</span> quux*)hvfs;
    <span class="kw">if</span>(type == msock_type) <span class="kw">return</span> &amp;self-&gt;mvfs;
    <span class="kw">if</span>(type == quux_type) <span class="kw">return</span> self;
    errno = ENOTSUP;
    <span class="kw">return</span> NULL;
}</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we are going to add implementation for send and receive functions.</p>
<p>Note that <code>quux_msendl()</code> and <code>quux_mrecvl()</code> get pointer to to msock virtual function table. We'll have to convert that to the pointer to quux object somehow. To make that easier let's define following handy macro:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="ot">#define cont(ptr, type, member) \</span>
    ((type*)(((<span class="dt">char</span>*) ptr) - offsetof(type, member)))</code></pre>
<p>The macro converts pointer to an embedded structure to a pointer of the enclosing structure. Now we can convert the <code>mvfs</code> into pointer to quux object:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">struct</span> quux *self = cont(mvfs, <span class="kw">struct</span> quux, mvfs);</code></pre>
<p>Let's say that quux protocol will prefix individual messages with 8-bit size. It means that messages can be at most 255 bytes long. But who cares? It's just a tutorial, after all.</p>
<p>To send such message we have to compute the size of the message first. We can iterate over the <code>iolist</code> (linked list of buffers, libdill's alternative to POSIX <code>iovec</code>) and sum all the buffer sizes. If size is greater than 255, tough luck. And actually, we'll use numbers 254 and 255 for special purposes later on, so limit the message size to 253 bytes:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">size_t sz = <span class="dv">0</span>;
<span class="kw">struct</span> iolist *it;
<span class="kw">for</span>(it = first; it; it = it-&gt;iol_next)
    sz += it-&gt;iol_len;
<span class="kw">if</span>(sz &gt; <span class="dv">253</span>) {errno = EMSGSIZE; <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;}</code></pre>
<p>Now we can send the size and the payload to the underlying socket:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">uint8_t</span> c = (<span class="dt">uint8_t</span>)sz;
<span class="dt">int</span> rc = bsend(self-&gt;u, &amp;c, <span class="dv">1</span>, deadline);
<span class="kw">if</span>(rc &amp;lt; <span class="dv">0</span>) <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;
rc = bsendl(self-&gt;u, first, last, deadline);
<span class="kw">if</span>(rc &amp;lt; <span class="dv">0</span>) <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;</code></pre>
<p>Return zero and the send function is done.</p>
<p>As for receive function we'll have to read 8-bit size first:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">uint8_t</span> c;
<span class="dt">int</span> rc = brecv(self-&gt;u, &amp;c, <span class="dv">1</span>, deadline);
<span class="kw">if</span>(rc &amp;lt; <span class="dv">0</span>) <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;</code></pre>
<p>User may pass in <code>NULL</code> instead of the buffer which means we should silently drop the message:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">if</span>(!first) {
    rc = brecv(self-&gt;u, NULL, c, deadline);
    <span class="kw">if</span>(rc &amp;lt; <span class="dv">0</span>) <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;
    <span class="kw">return</span> c;
}</code></pre>
<p>The size of the message may not match size of the buffer supplied by the user. If message is larger than the buffer we will simply return an error. However, if message is smaller than the buffer we have to shrink the buffer to the appropriate size. We can do so by modifying the iolist. Note that iolist is not supposed be thread- or coroutine-safe and thus we can modify it as long as we revert it to its original state before returning from the function. Once the iolist is modified we can read the message payload from the underlying socket:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">size_t rmn = c;
<span class="kw">struct</span> iolist *it = first;
<span class="kw">while</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>) {
    <span class="kw">if</span>(it-&gt;iol_len &gt;= rmn) <span class="kw">break</span>;
    rmn -= it-&gt;iol_len;
    it = it-&gt;iol_next;
    <span class="kw">if</span>(!it) {errno = EMSGSIZE; <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;}
}
<span class="kw">struct</span> iolist orig = *it;
it-&gt;iol_len = rmn;
it-&gt;iol_next = NULL;
rc = brecvl(self-&gt;u, first, last, deadline);
*it = orig;
<span class="kw">if</span>(rc &amp;lt; <span class="dv">0</span>) <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have received the message we have to return its size to the user:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">return</span> c;</code></pre>
<p>And finally, we can test whether the protocol works as expected. Let's send a simple text message (string with a terminating zero) to one end of the connection and receive it at the other end.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">coroutine <span class="dt">void</span> client(<span class="dt">int</span> s) {
    ...
    msend(q, <span class="st">&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</span>, <span class="dv">14</span>, -<span class="dv">1</span>);
    ...
}

<span class="dt">int</span> main(<span class="dt">void</span>) {
    ...
    <span class="dt">char</span> buf[<span class="dv">256</span>];
    mrecv(q, buf, <span class="kw">sizeof</span>(buf), -<span class="dv">1</span>);
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;%s</span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, buf);
    ...
}</code></pre>
<p>Compile and test the program!</p>
<h2 id="step-5-error-handling">Step 5: Error handling</h2>
<p>Consider the following scenario: User asks to receive a message. The message is 200 bytes long. However, after reading 100 bytes, receive function times out. That puts you, as the protocol implementor, into an unconfortable position. There's no way to push the 100 bytes that were already received back to the underlying socket. libdill sockets provide no API for that, but even in principle, it would mean that the underlying socket would need an unlimited buffer. Just imagine receiving a 1TB message and timing out just before its fully read...</p>
<p>libdill solves this problem by not trying too hard to recover from errors, even from seemingly recoverable ones like ETIMEOUT.</p>
<p>When building on top of a bytestream protocol, which in unrecoverable by definition, you thus have to track failures and once error happens return an error for any subsequent attampts to receive a message. Same reasoning and same solution applies to outbound messages.</p>
<p>(Note that this does not apply when you are building on top of a message socket. Message sockets may be recoverable. Just think of UDP. Thus, in that case you should just forward and send and received requests to the underlying socket and let it take care of error handling for you.)</p>
<p>Anyway, to implement error handling in quux protocol, let's add to booleans to the socket to track whether sending/receiving had failed already:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">struct</span> quux {
    <span class="kw">struct</span> hvfs hvfs;
    <span class="kw">struct</span> msock_vfs mvfs;
    <span class="dt">int</span> u;
    <span class="dt">int</span> senderr;
    <span class="dt">int</span> recverr;
};</code></pre>
<p>Initialize them to false in <code>quux_attach()</code> function:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">self-&gt;senderr = <span class="dv">0</span>;
self-&gt;recverr = <span class="dv">0</span>;</code></pre>
<p>Set <code>senderr</code> to true every time when sending fails and <code>recverr</code> to true every time when receiving fails. For example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">if</span>(sz &gt; <span class="dv">253</span>) {self-&gt;senderr = <span class="dv">1</span>; errno = EMSGSIZE; <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;}</code></pre>
<p>Finally, fail send and receive function if the error flag is set:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">int</span> quux_msendl(<span class="kw">struct</span> msock_vfs *mvfs,
      <span class="kw">struct</span> iolist *first, <span class="kw">struct</span> iolist *last, <span class="dt">int64_t</span> deadline) {
    <span class="kw">struct</span> quux *self = cont(mvfs, <span class="kw">struct</span> quux, mvfs);
    <span class="kw">if</span>(self-&gt;senderr) {errno = ECONNRESET; <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;}
    ...
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="step-6-initial-handshake">Step 6: Initial handshake</h2>
<p>Let's say we want to support mutliple versions of quux protocol. When a quux connection is established peers will exchange their version numbers and if they don't match, they will fail.</p>
<p>In fact, we don't even need proper handshake for that. Each peer can simply send its version number and wait for version number from the other party. We'll do this work in <code>quux_attach()</code> function. And given that sending and receiving are blocking operations <code>quux_attach()</code> will become a blocking operation itself:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">int</span> quux_attach(<span class="dt">int</span> u, <span class="dt">int64_t</span> deadline) {
    ...

<p>Note that failure of initial handshake not only prevent initialization of quux sockets, it also closes the underlying sockets. This is necessary because otherwise the underlying sockets will be left in undefined state, with just half of quux handshake being done.</p>
<p>Of course, we'll have to modify the test program to pass deadlines to <code>quux_attach()</code> function invocations.</p>
<h2 id="step-7-terminal-handshake">Step 7: Terminal handshake</h2>
<p>Imagine that user wants to close the quux protocol and start a new protocol, say HTTP, on top of the same underlying connection. For that to work both peers would have to make sure that they've received all quux-related data before proceeding. If they did not the leftover quux data would confuse the subsequent HTTP protocol.</p>
<p>To achieve that peers will send a single termination byte (255) each to another to mark end of the stream of quux messages. After doing so they will read any receive and drop quux messages from the peer until they receive the 255 byte. At that point all the quux data are cleaned up, both peers have consistent view of the world and HTTP protocol can be safely initiated.</p>
<p>Let's add to flags to the quux socket object, one meaning &quot;termination byte was already sent&quot;, the other &quot;termination byte was already received&quot;:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">struct</span> quux {
    ...
    <span class="dt">int</span> senddone;
    <span class="dt">int</span> recvdone;
};</code></pre>
<p>The flags have to be initialized in the <code>quux_attach()</code> function:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">int</span> quux_attach(<span class="dt">int</span> u, <span class="dt">int64_t</span> deadline) {
    ...
    self-&gt;senddone = <span class="dv">0</span>;
    self-&gt;recvdone = <span class="dv">0</span>;
    ...
}</code></pre>
<p>If termination byte was already sent send function should return <code>EPIPE</code> error:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">int</span> quux_msendl(<span class="kw">struct</span> msock_vfs *mvfs,
      <span class="kw">struct</span> iolist *first, <span class="kw">struct</span> iolist *last, <span class="dt">int64_t</span> deadline) {
    ...
    <span class="kw">if</span>(self-&gt;senddone) {errno = EPIPE; <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;}
    ...

}</code></pre>
<p>If termination byte was already received receive function should return <code>EPIPE</code> error. Also, we should handle the case when termination byte is originally received from the peer:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">static</span> ssize_t quux_mrecvl(<span class="kw">struct</span> msock_vfs *mvfs,
      <span class="kw">struct</span> iolist *first, <span class="kw">struct</span> iolist *last, <span class="dt">int64_t</span> deadline) {
    ...
    <span class="kw">if</span>(self-&gt;recvdone) {errno = EPIPE; <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;}
    ...
    <span class="kw">if</span>(c == <span class="dv">255</span>) {self-&gt;recvdone = <span class="dv">1</span>; errno = EPIPE; <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;}
    ...
}</code></pre>
<p>Virtual function <code>hdone()</code> that we've so far left unimplemented is supposed to start the terminal handshake. However, it is not supposed to wait till it is finished. The semantics of <code>hdone()</code> &quot;user is not going to send more data&quot;. You can think of it as an EOF marker of kind.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">int</span> quux_hdone(<span class="kw">struct</span> hvfs *hvfs, <span class="dt">int64_t</span> deadline) {
    <span class="kw">struct</span> quux *self = (<span class="kw">struct</span> quux*)hvfs;
    <span class="kw">if</span>(self-&gt;senddone) {errno = EPIPE; <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;}
    <span class="kw">if</span>(self-&gt;senderr) {errno = ECONNRESET; <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;}
    <span class="dt">uint8_t</span> c = <span class="dv">255</span>;
    <span class="dt">int</span> rc = bsend(self-&gt;u, &amp;c, <span class="dv">1</span>, deadline);
    <span class="kw">if</span>(rc &amp;lt; <span class="dv">0</span>) {self-&gt;senderr = <span class="dv">1</span>; <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;}
    self-&gt;senddone = <span class="dv">1</span>;
    <span class="kw">return</span> <span class="dv">0</span>;
}</code></pre>
<p>At this point we can modify <code>quux_detach()</code> function so that it properly cleans up any leftover protocol data.</p>
<p>First, it will send the termination byte if it was not already sent. Then it will receive and drop messages until it receives the termination byte:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">int</span> quux_detach(<span class="dt">int</span> h, <span class="dt">int64_t</span> deadline) {
    <span class="dt">int</span> err;
    <span class="kw">struct</span> quux *self = hquery(h, quux_type);
    <span class="kw">if</span>(!self) <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;
    <span class="kw">if</span>(self-&gt;senderr || self-&gt;recverr) {err = ECONNRESET; <span class="kw">goto</span> error;}
    <span class="kw">if</span>(!self-&gt;senddone) {
        <span class="dt">int</span> rc = quux_hdone(&amp;self-&gt;hvfs, deadline);
        <span class="kw">if</span>(rc &lt; <span class="dv">0</span>) {err = errno; <span class="kw">goto</span> error;}
    }
    <span class="kw">while</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>) {
        ssize_t sz = quux_mrecvl(&amp;self-&gt;mvfs, NULL, NULL, deadline);
        <span class="kw">if</span>(sz &lt; <span class="dv">0</span> &amp;&amp; errno == EPIPE) <span class="kw">break</span>;
        <span class="kw">if</span>(sz &lt; <span class="dv">0</span>) {err = errno; <span class="kw">goto</span> error;}
    }
    <span class="dt">int</span> u = self-&gt;u;
    free(self);
    <span class="kw">return</span> u;
error:
    quux_hclose(&amp;self-&gt;hvfs);
    errno = err;
    <span class="kw">return</span> -<span class="dv">1</span>;
}</code></pre>
